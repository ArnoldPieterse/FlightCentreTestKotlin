Android app that shows flights in a List. When you select a flight it takes you to the flight description view. In the flight description view you can show basic info.

Technologies uses:
- Kotlin

- Convert GMT times to local
- Jetpack's Room could be used to save flights locally
- Before app release, Firebase bug tracker integration would be recommended
- Layout design and potentially adding rounded corners
